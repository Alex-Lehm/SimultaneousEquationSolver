# SimultaneousEquationSolver
Simple Python project to solve 2-dimensional linear equations simultaneously, using elimination.

To run the program:
* Run `run.py` for a clear example.

To run the tests:
* _Recommendation: use Pytest to run the following test files._
* Run `test_formulae.py` to run tests of the Highest Common Factor and Lowest
Common Multiple functions.
* (TO BE CREATED) Run `test_equation_solver.py` to run tests for the main 
simultaneous equation solver.
